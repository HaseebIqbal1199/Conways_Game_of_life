## 🧠 Conway's Game of Life Rules

The Game of Life follows four simple rules:

1. **Birth**: A dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors becomes alive
2. **Survival**: A live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors stays alive
3. **Underpopulation**: A live cell with fewer than 2 neighbors dies
4. **Overpopulation**: A live cell with more than 3 neighbors dies

These simple rules create complex, emergent behaviors and patterns!
